OPEN -7/8/2025 - just added black canvas backpack in the aleveric mod. it is spawning in industrial. i purposely did not server wipe to see if this is causing nvgheadstrap assault and mich2001helmet to not spawn. 
so far i did not see the mich2001helmet. sometimes i think the server wipe helps with the initail spawn but there is something in the backend after it spawns that is stopping it from spawning agai.
Check again in a couple hours to see if those itesm have spawned, if not, consider getting rid of the canvas balck backlpack from ALV mod or just change the location so it's not included with industrial.

^^^still look into this potential problem, still potentially open problem - THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE TWO ITEMS (ALSO INCLDUING THE BLACK ASSAULT HELMET) ARE STARTING TO SPAWN IN AT RESTART OR WIPE
BUT THEN DO NOT RESPAWN AGAIN UNTIL AFTER ANOTHER WIPE OR RESTART

-now working on lowering as many noms as possible...


-items NOT SEEING SPAWNED IN (POTENTIAL / NOT ACTUAL CONFIRMED PROBLEMS LIKE MICH2001HELEMT AND NVGHEADSTRAP) 
-SCAR-H - CLOSED - SEEN SPAWNING
