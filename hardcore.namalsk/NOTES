just added black canvas backpack in the aleveric mod. it is spawning in industrial. i purposely did not server wipe to see if this is causing nvgheadstrap assault and mich2001helmet to not spawn. so far i did not see the 
mich2001helmet. sometimes i think the server wipe helps with the initail spawn but there is something in the backend after it spawns that is stopping it from spawning agai. Check again in a couple hours to see if those
itesm have spawned, if not, consider getting rid of the canvas balck backlpack from ALV mod or just change the location so it's not included with industrial.
