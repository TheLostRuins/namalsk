OPEN -7/8/2025 - just added black canvas backpack in the aleveric mod. it is spawning in industrial. i purposely did not server wipe to see if this is causing nvgheadstrap assault and mich2001helmet to not spawn. 
so far i did not see the mich2001helmet. sometimes i think the server wipe helps with the initail spawn but there is something in the backend after it spawns that is stopping it from spawning agai.
Check again in a couple hours to see if those itesm have spawned, if not, consider getting rid of the canvas balck backlpack from ALV mod or just change the location so it's not included with industrial.

^^^still look into this potential problem, still potentially open problem - THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE TWO ITEMS (ALSO INCLDUING THE BLACK ASSAULT HELMET) ARE STARTING TO SPAWN IN AT RESTART OR WIPE
BUT THEN DO NOT RESPAWN AGAIN UNTIL AFTER ANOTHER WIPE OR RESTART

-now working on lowering as many noms as possible...

------------------

next steps for overhaul changes.

re-upload the .map file bc we updated it. (this file potentially needs to be read again bc we edited the xml technically so re-uploading is necessary) 

x-1742 y-9.4 z-8628


then take the individual zombie spawns from the .map file xml version and add those indidividual zombie spawn locations to the env-zombie spawn xml file. you should see the other 2 zombie spawn locations (army)
as well as the other bear spawn (in different file).
